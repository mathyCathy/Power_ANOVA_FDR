# Power_ANOVA_FDR
Sample size and power calculations for 1-way ANOVA rolling in FDR

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Background and setup

* 3-group exposure (n1 = 200, n2 = 20, n3 = 20)
* Continuous outcome (can assumed to be normally distributed and standardized)
* Comparisons via ANOVA
* 3000-4000 protein (outcomes) so want to control FDR
* Ideally, assumed N, 80% and produce minimal detectable effect sizes
